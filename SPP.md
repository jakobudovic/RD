## Inspiration

I spent a lot of time deciding on the project topic for the course R&D. That's why I am writing this a few hours before the deadline. To this very day I am still not fully decided on what exactly should I do/focus on, but I'll try my best to explain it here.

I have to expose that I am an exchange student so I might not have obtained the same knowledge as my peers here. We did use Java for OOP, C and assembly for some lower level programming, web development in the first year, DBs etc. I have also not followed the course Requirements engineering so I am starting from 0. 

After consulting with my TA I have decided to mainly work on individually addressable LEDs. In the first week of April I ordered the material I think I need for the project. Parts are slowly arriving but I will touch on that later.

## Idea(s)

My idea was to control LEDs with music. Output sound of my laptop would serve as an input for the LEDs. This would be more of a hardware project with later on added extra GUI on added website.  
My original idea was to use RPI as a controller for the LEDs. But since I would also like to use it as my storage server, wifi router blocking all ads and a host for the personal website (that I would also like to develop and host there), it could become overloaded. That's why I got separate **NodeMCU Esp8266** (with wi-fi option) which would be in charge of the LEDs.

A lot of research (a part of it already done while purchasing material) and knowledge will be required for just the hardware part itself. Picking right material was/is crucial because assembly can not be done with a part missing. And it takes almost a month (sometimes even more) for it to come from China. So if anything goes south during the project, I am more or less stuck.

But why am I saying all this?

## Doubts

Since I have never worked with Raspberry pi 4 (which I also got) and other electronics (that are still on their way), it could hapen that I did not get all the right parts. So if I ever get stuck with my project, it would become more like **Sit and Wait** instead of **Research and Development** project (see what I did there?).

## Plan 

For the LED part it's more or less self explanatory. Adapter powers LED strip, nodeMCU communicates with laptop and controls LEDs. Different effects/modes  will be implemented/used for different light shows.

At some point I am planning to implement GUI for not only easier control of the LEDs, but also for the services that would make my life easier. GUI aka website will also include an info page about me and my skills, achievements and interests... Depending on how smoothly everything goes, I would also like to add an mp3 converter from YT video/ spotify link to, well an mp3 file.  
I could add a spotify widget of the current song playing on my account, as well as favorite song of the past week. I think that would be interesting for some of my friends too! 

## Conclusion

It's hard to focus on just one thing because of the material I am still waiting on. That's why my project, at the moment, consists of a collection of things I would like to research and develop.  
I could say it's a project of exploring home automation, web services and digital circuits, where everything revolves around music.

Since I am still waiting on some crucial parts for the hardware part of my MAIN project (LEDs), I will start with "side projects" (website, RPI setup) first so I don't waste time during the holidays. 

## Hint
If you have an ultrawide monitor (I don't), this SPP, I hope, streches over 10-20 lines. So I am safe. ;)
